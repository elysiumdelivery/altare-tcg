Magni Dezmond, another streamer in Altare's guild, comments "wait what in the actual fuck this is insane"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47371080/216844946-ccb15294-fb87-4ee9-b102-48f0f5645d10.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42uQ_AvFaFk&t=1475)

## Features
Cards have rarities (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Holo rare, Ultra rare, Secret rare) and animations as inspired by the official Pokemon TCG. Thanks to https://github.com/simeydotme/pokemon-cards-css for the animations!

The Rare is slightly shinier than the Uncommon, and the Ultra Rare has a rainbow gradient and fine, wavy foil texture.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47371080/216848016-095fd74f-0f94-4b74-8300-cc72cf9dd99e.gif)

You can pet him!

The Home button pokes out at an angle behind him.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47371080/216846048-a080470e-8870-4e42-a56d-b4e62eccd953.gif)


# Contributing

Make a local copy of the repo

`git clone https://github.com/elysiumdelivery/altare-tcg.git`

Inside the created folder, run the following to install dev dependencies.

`npm install`

Make a local branch (you cannot push changes directly to `main`). `<your-branch-name>` can be any name you want.

`git checkout -b <your-branch-name> origin/main`

## Local hot refresh

Because browsers are finnicky about accessing local files if there isn't a web server serving the page, live-server starts a development server and serves from there. Go to the folder you saved the git repo in and run

`live-server`

and the app should be served at `http://localhost:8080`, auto-reloading on each file save.

## Non-coder

You can use the Github UI for simple text changes/ typo fixes:

To submit your changes for review, please select "Create a new branch... and start a pull request".

# Pull Requests

Push your local branch to Github to create a pull request

`git push -u origin <your-branch-name>`

Your terminal will then prompt you for your credentials. The password will be your personal access token. Here are steps on how to create one: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
