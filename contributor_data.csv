Spur || lurkn_ssprdyllc,@lurkn_ssprdyllc,"HBD Regis Altare! The Holostar and Cult Leader of the TEMPUS Guild! Hopefully, by your next birthday, your hair will still be blue rather than gray. But if you become bald after all the stress caused by managing a guild of troublemakers seiso adventurers and doing your best to fend off records corruption (abayo VODs o7), don't worry,  we'll still watch your videos. We'd even make you a ton of wigs and hats, just say the word and we'll get started on them lmao. Treat yourself to a few leisurely days of relaxation if you can, leader! Otsu otsu!"
Squidman ,@Squidman_3,"Happy Birthday Altare!! I am so glad that you joined HoloPro and helped start the HoloStars EN branch. You have helped and inspired more than you could ever know the last few months and I am grateful to have a comfy streamer to watch whenever I want. We know you said that you like to celebrate your birthday in a low-key kinda fashion, but we wanted to do something special for someone who has done some incredible things for so many people in such a short time. Hoping your birthday is fantastic and you can enjoy it in the way you want. Just know that we are grateful that you are our Leader of the Tempus Guild."

tootles,@tootlini,"Happy Birthday to our most ambitious, hard-working, entertaining, sometimes clumsy, always demonic, talented guild leader of Tempus, Regis Altare! Ever since debut, you and your streams have been the highlight of each and every day. Your laughter is infectious, and your puns are… 2/10 at best, but since it’s your special day, we’ll give them 11/10. But seriously, we can’t thank you enough for all you’ve done for us, and continue to do, to make us smile. Hope you enjoy this gift from the fans and have a super amazing birthday. We love you!"

Just want to let you know about how much your contents had helped many of us to get through the hard times of days and nights. Especially for night since the stars in the cards reminded how they made myself calm after very stressful night shifts. And your streams like stars to me, so thank you so much Leader! Even though some of them were very cursed and confusing lol. Hope you have an epic and swell bday regardless!"
